Task - plot similar time series of temperature and precipitation anomalies (historical and SSPs) for 
1. land-only, CD
2. global tropics (say 30S - 30 N), CD
3. Indian land region (70-90E, 5-28N). CD

Task - [ Done for historical ] Spatial map of mean JJAS precipitation and 850 hPa wind over South and East Asia (40S:40N, 50E - 120E) from 
the pre-industrial control (piControl) simulations. Compute the multi-model mean (MMM) of all CMIP6 models. 
 
Task - Spatial map of trend in JJAS precipitation and 850 hPa wind in the historical simulation over the period 1950 to  2014. 
1. For each cmip6 model, CD
2. The multimodel mean. CD

Task - make the spatial maps of unmasked regions CD

Task - plot the mean annual cycle of precipitation over India for each of these models using the r1i1p1f1 ensemble member.
     - average over the last 10 years of the historical simulation CD

-----------------
Task - focus on two future periods one up to the 2050s 
    -  2025 to 2055, and
    -  2069 to 2099. 
    Do the analysis focusing on Asian summer monsoon rainfall (also using MME but better to check for model spread) 
    and for different scenario SSPs 1-1.9, 2-4.5, 3-7.0, and 5-8.5. 
    
    - What would be the signal to noise ratio (MME future change/ Inter model SD) 
    
for these two future periods in different scenario which will show uncertainty in the future projection as well? 
 
- Note that future change is defined as ===  mean climatology of far (near) future period minus mean of historical period (1975 to 2005 or so). 
 
- Also this will be a spatial plot. We can think about doing a time series later on.
